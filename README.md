BOSP_Anroid_Packages_BionxDashboard
===================================

Recent Open Source code of the Bionx Dashboard with CardsLib GUI. LTS update coming in the summer as well as its counter part "BET" Bionx Elite Toolkit.

The Bionx Dashboard is an Open Source Toolkit based off of tweaks from AOSP, AOKP, CM and other home brew tweaks created by moi. This toolkit ran the Bionx Catalyst rom for the Droid Razr as well as offering other android users SU Utilities as well as Tools like File Management, App Process Management, Build.Prop editing and CPU Overclocking management. Supports Android 4.1.2-4.4.2. Some processes will fail on Android Kitkat because the code is up-to-date with Google Guidelines.
